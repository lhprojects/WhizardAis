1.
It's convienient for you to have copy of the scripts

2.
You need to use the container to setup enviroment of cluster6

For example
```
source /PATH/to/container
```bash

NOTE: You should be able to access e.g. /besfs.
But you can't access /cefs except the directory you are currently in and it's sub-directory.
The compilation depends on some file in /cefs/higgs/liangh/... .
So please source the /PATH/to/container in the directory like `/cefs/higgs`,
so that you can acess your files and mines at the same time.

3.
Then you can use the remaining scripts following the moxin's guide, see README
