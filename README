The mkproc.sh script is used to make the steering files
for all the processes defined in the input prc file. Four
parameters have to be send to mkproc.sh:

1) The pattern mkproc.sh works with:
-p make all the SM backgrounds
-h make the Higgs processes
-a make di-photon backgrounds

2) The prc file in which the required processes defined
there are several well defined prc files in the directory:
2fermions.prc for the 2 fermions SM backgrounds,
4fermions.prc for the 4 fermions SM backgrounds,
6fermions.prc for the 6 fermions SM backgrounds, including
                  the t-tbar processes, specific to 350GeV,
higgs.prc     for the higgs production, classified according
                  to the decay products of higgs,
gamma.prc     for the di-photon backgrounds, needs tuning.

3) The center of mass energy. Be aware that the 6fermions.prc
   is programed only under 350GeV case.

4) The directory where you want the samples located

The gramma is "source mkproc.sh -pattern XXX.prc cms path". After it
completed, all the steering files will be created under the current
location, and classified according to the processes defined in the prc
file. The samples will be generated under the location specified by the
parameter path.

For the users who want to generate samples with specific models, first
the model name in the prc should be changed to the new one, and the
model file has to be installed at $whizard_dir/conf/models/.
